Write a python function that takes a string of Typescript source text and strips off all block comments (/* ... */) and those line comments that don't begin with "// Hint: ".

I am interested in a basic RE approach that doesn't correctly handle string literals containing "//", "/*", and "*/". However, please advise me on ways to handle string literals.

Place any generated files in copilot/comments.
